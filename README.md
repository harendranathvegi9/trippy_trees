Animated visualization of fall leaves using object-oriented programming in Processing


On a recent trip to my alma mater, I was inspired by the amount of life in the Arboretum, and decided to create an animated visualization of a breathing autumn landscape.

I used object-oriented programming to create animated mathematical functions resulting in a rhythm of colors and pulses for the trees, moon, and land.

To run: download files, open "trippy_trees.pde" using Processing and press play.
